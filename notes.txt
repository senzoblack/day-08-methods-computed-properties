Methods vs Computed

Methods
- Functions that are meant to be called
- Can have parameters passed in
- Re-evaluated every time they're called
- Not meant to be a property

Computed Properties
- Intended to compute existing data
- Shouldn't have parameters passed in
- Cached based on their dependencies 
- Should be used as a property

A good rule of thumb to follow:
- Use methods when responding to the changes (e.g clicking a button, submitting a form, etc) or to run explicit functionality chnage within the instance (e.g have a method called from lifestyle hook).
- Use computed properties for data manipulation (e.g create a sorted array from an unsorted array in the instance).
